          <p>
            At Epicodus, you'll learn how to build web sites and mobile apps from top to bottom with modern technologies and practices. More importantly than any particular skill, though, you'll learn how to think like a programmer, write good code, and pick up new skills in this fast-changing industry.

          <p>
            Epicodus graduates work at companies as small as 3-person startups, as big as a Fortune 100 company, and everything in between. Through internship programs, job fairs, and hands-on support from our staff, we make it easy for companies to connect with our students.
